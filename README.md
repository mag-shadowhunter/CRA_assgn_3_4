This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files:

  • "CodeBook.md" is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the
       data
       
  • "run_analysis.R" performs the data preparation/assignment and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course 
      project’s reqirement:            
      
              o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
              o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
              o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
              o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
              o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each                     activity and each subject.
              
  •	"Tidy.txt" is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
